# Optional override: attach django-api to the Kind Docker network so "Use Kind network"
# works without running `docker network connect kind ...` manually.
# Use only after you have created a Kind cluster (e.g. kind create cluster --name demo).
# Start with: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.kind.yml up -d
# If the "kind" network does not exist, compose will fail; create a Kind cluster first.
